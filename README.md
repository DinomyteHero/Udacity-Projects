# Description
I created these projects as a part of completing my Udacity Nanodegree in Programming for Data Science for Enterprise.

# SQL Project
There was a database wherein I had to query to find information that can help the business. After which I had to make a PDF which summarized the analyzed data into an readable form along with graphs the help illistrate the data.

# Python Project
I had to create a script which would show you statistics based on the information that was in an database. It prompts the user to enter the city, month, and day for which they want statistics from.  There is also an option to get raw data from the database.
